   ↓
2. Redirected to Shopify checkout
   ↓

## 🔧 Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Add BASE_URL to .env

Add this to your `.env` file:

```bash
# For local development
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# For production (when deployed)
# BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### Step 2: Configure Shopify Checkout Settings

1. **Login to Shopify Admin**
2. **Go to:** Settings → Checkout
3. **Scroll to:** "Order status page"
4. **Additional scripts** (optional - for tracking):
   ```html
   <script>
   console.log('Order completed!');
   </script>
   ```

### Step 3: Set Up Custom Domain (Production Only)

For production, you'll want to use your custom domain:

1. **Update .env**:
   ```bash
   BASE_URL=https://aquaticavenue.com
   ```

2. **Redeploy** your application

3. **Test** the return URL

## 📱 What Customers See

### After Successful Payment:

1. **Shopify shows:** "Order confirmed" page
2. **Then redirects to:** `your-site.com/payment/success`
3. **Customer sees:**
   - ✅ Animated checkmark
   - 🎉 "Order Received!" message
   - 📧 What happens next
   - 🛍️ "Continue Shopping" button

4. **Cart is cleared** automatically
5. **Customer clicks "Continue Shopping"**
6. **Returns to homepage** with empty cart

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

2. **Add items to cart**

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Return URL Validation:

- Shopify validates the return URL domain
- Must match your store's allowed domains
- HTTPS required in production

### Cart Clearing:

- Cart is cleared on success page load
- Uses localStorage (client-side)
- No sensitive data exposed

---

## 🎨 Customizing the Success Page

### Current Features:

- ✅ Animated checkmark
- ✅ Order reference display
- ✅ "What happens next" section
- ✅ Continue shopping button
- ✅ Contact information

### To Customize:

Edit `views/payment-success.hbs`:

```handlebars
<!-- Change the message -->
<h1>Your Custom Message</h1>

<!-- Add custom content -->
<div class="custom-section">
  <!-- Your content here -->
</div>

<!-- Modify the button -->
<a href="/shop" class="btn">Browse Products</a>
```

## 📊 Monitoring Returns

  gtag('event', 'purchase', {
    transaction_id: '{{reference}}',
    value: {{total}},
    currency: 'SGD'
  });
  
  // Facebook Pixel
  fbq('track', 'Purchase', {
    value: {{total}},
    currency: 'SGD'
  });
